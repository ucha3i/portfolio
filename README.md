# Portfolio ðŸŽ¨

The first version of my frontend developer portfolio. I build it using HTML and CSS.

It shows projects I've already done through the bootcamp. I'll update it in the future, adding new, both private and bootcamp projects. 

I also link to articles I wrote on Medium, where I share my thougths about learing and coding.
